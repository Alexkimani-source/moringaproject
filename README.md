A Go CLI tool that fetches coordinates for a location using OpenStreetMap Nominatim API.
# Prompt-Powered Kickstart: Building a Location-to-Coordinates CLI with Go

# Overview
This project is a command-line application built with Go that converts a location name into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) using the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API.
## Technology chosen : GO
**Why I chose it:**
I chose Go because it is efficient, beginner-friendly, and widely used for backend services and APIs. I wanted to learn how to make HTTP requests, handle JSON data, and work with real-world API responses.
**End goal:**
To build a command-line application that fetches latitude and longitude for a given location using the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API, demonstrating real-world API integration.
